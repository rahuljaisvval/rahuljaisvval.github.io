												<h3>Initial ideation</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Taking the time to draft iterations of each screen of the app on paper ensured that the elements that made it to digital wireframes would be well-suited to address user pain points. For the home screen, I prioritized a quick and easy selection process to help users save time.

											<p>After ideating and drafting some paper wireframes, I created the initial designs for the Kukido app. These designs focused on delivering a simple to use clutter free design that can be easily used with talkback.

												<h3>Low Fidelity Prototype</h3>

											<p>To prepare for usability testing, I created a low-fidelity prototype that connected the user flow from items in the bag to adding the address and then to ordering it.

												<h3>Usability study: findings
												</h3>
											</header>
											<p>These were the main findings uncovered by the usability study: 
											</p>
											<ul>
												<li>People want clutter free user interface .
												</li>
												<li>People had difficulty with adding customization options.
												</li>
												<li>Some users found it annoying having to customize again, if somehow their item was removed from the cart.
												</li>
												<li>People preferred clear indications of navigation within the app.
												</li>

												<h3>Changes after usability study:</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Based on the insights from the usability study, I applied design changes like providing a clear indication navigating through the app. To browse bakery items and custom cakes that were saved before user can use “favorites”. <br> <br> Additional design changes included adding an option to save their custom cakes so the users can save items for later, in case they can not order at the moment.

												<h3>High Fidelity Prototypes</h3>
											</header>
											<p>The high-fidelity prototype followed the same user flow as the low-fidelity prototype, including design changes made after the usability study. Using appealing animations to inform users what was happening, I tried to make the User experienceboth easy and fun to use.

												<h3>Takeaways</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Simplicity is key: A 'simple' design that is easy to navigate, with clear menus and intuitive controls. Avoid clutter and unnecessary features that can make the app confusing or overwhelming for users.
												<br>
												<br>
												User Research on potential clients: To understand their unique needs and goals for the website is important for creating a design that aligns with their needs and goals.
												<br>
												<br>
												Visual appeal matters: Making sure the app looks good, with high-quality images of the bakery's baked goods that are sure to make customers' mouths water. Using an appealing color scheme and typography that is easy to read.
												<br>
												<br>
												Prioritize user experience: Putting myself in the shoes of the app's users and think about their needs and preferences. Consider their pain points, such as long wait times or confusion when placing orders, and design the app to address these issues.
												
												<br>
												<br>
												Listen to feedback: Listening to customer feedback and make adjustments as needed. Identifying areas where users may be experiencing issues or dropping off, and use this data to make informed design decisions.
